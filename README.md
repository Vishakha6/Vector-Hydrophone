# Vector-Hydrophone
Vector hydrophones are underwater acoustic receivers used to determine the direction in which a sound wave is traveling using measurements made at a single point in space. Two types of vector hydrophones- T-shaped and 4-Beam were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics. Stress and strain analysis was carried out to find out the relation between voltage and sound pressure waves.
